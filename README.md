CadeGPT

CadeGPT is a full-stack AI chat application built with FastAPI, a modern web-based chat interface, and a pluggable large-language-model backend. It was designed to demonstrate how real AI products are built: with clean backend architecture, structured APIs, and a frontend that never talks directly to an AI model. The entire system runs locally using Ollama for free real-time inference, while still being designed to later support hosted providers such as OpenAI. Unlike simple demos, CadeGPT now also includes a real cloud database so every conversation and message is permanently stored.

The application works by exposing a single backend endpoint at POST /api/chat. The web UI sends user messages to this endpoint, and the FastAPI backend creates or loads a conversation, routes the request to the correct language model provider based on environment configuration, receives the AI response, stores both the user message and assistant reply in the database, and returns a structured response to the client. This allows the same frontend and API to work with mock models for testing, local models through Ollama for free inference, or paid hosted models without changing any UI or API code. This separation of concerns mirrors how production AI platforms are designed.

CadeGPT is built around a clean service-oriented architecture. The routing layer handles HTTP requests, the service layer coordinates chat logic, the database layer persists conversations and messages, and a dedicated provider layer communicates with the selected language model. Each AI response is wrapped in a structured object that includes not only the generated text but also metadata such as which model was used, which environment is running, the timestamp of the request, a unique request identifier, and the conversation ID. This makes logging, analytics, monitoring, and replay of conversations straightforward.

The frontend is a lightweight but fully functional chat interface that runs directly in the browser. It communicates exclusively with the FastAPI backend, rendering both user messages and assistant responses in real time. Because the UI depends only on the API, it remains stable regardless of which AI provider or database is used behind the scenes. This makes the system easy to extend, deploy, or upgrade without rewriting the frontend.

CadeGPT is intentionally designed around Supabase for persistent memory. Supabase provides a PostgreSQL database that stores conversations and messages, allowing CadeGPT to support real chat history, conversation continuity, and future user-level data. Every chat turn is written to the database, giving CadeGPT true memory instead of being a stateless chatbot. This transforms the project from a local AI demo into the foundation of a scalable SaaS-style AI platform.

The technology stack includes Python 3.13, FastAPI, Pydantic, Uvicorn, Supabase, Ollama, HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The system is configured using environment variables so secrets are never committed to GitHub and AI providers or databases can be swapped without touching application code. The entire project is designed to be clean, modular, and easy to understand for both developers and recruiters reviewing the repository.

Future development will build on this foundation by adding user accounts, authentication, and multi-conversation chat history. Supabase will allow CadeGPT to support multiple users, each with their own conversations and saved messages. Additional features such as loading past chats, conversation summaries, long-term memory, personalization, usage tracking, and billing can be layered on top without changing the existing API or UI. The architecture you see now is the same structure used by production systems like ChatGPT, Intercom, and enterprise support platforms.

CadeGPT exists as both a learning platform and a portfolio-ready AI application. It demonstrates full-stack engineering, API design, AI system integration, cloud database persistence, and modern software architecture patterns. It is not a simple chatbot but a well-structured AI platform that can evolve into a real product over time.
