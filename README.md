CadeGPT

CadeGPT is a full-stack AI chat application built with FastAPI, a modern web-based chat interface, and a pluggable large-language-model backend. It was designed to demonstrate how real AI products are built: with clean backend architecture, structured APIs, and a frontend that never talks directly to an AI model. The entire system runs locally using Ollama, allowing real AI inference with zero API cost, while still being designed to later support hosted providers such as OpenAI.

The application works by exposing a single backend endpoint at POST /api/chat. The web UI sends user messages to this endpoint, and the FastAPI backend routes the request to the correct language model provider based on environment configuration. This allows the same frontend and API to work with mock models for testing, local models through Ollama for free inference, or paid hosted models without changing any UI or API code. This separation of concerns mirrors how production AI platforms are designed.

CadeGPT is built around a clean service-oriented architecture. The routing layer handles HTTP requests, the service layer coordinates chat logic, and a dedicated provider layer communicates with the selected language model. Each AI response is wrapped in a structured object that includes not only the generated text but also metadata such as which model was used, which environment is running, the timestamp of the request, and a unique request identifier. This design makes it easy to add logging, analytics, monitoring, or persistence without changing how the UI works.

The frontend is a lightweight but fully functional chat interface that runs directly in the browser. It communicates exclusively with the FastAPI backend, rendering both user messages and assistant responses in real time. Because the UI depends only on the API, it remains stable regardless of which AI provider is used behind the scenes. This makes the system easy to extend, deploy, or upgrade without rewriting the frontend.

CadeGPT is intentionally designed to be extended with Supabase in the next phase of development. Supabase will provide authentication, a PostgreSQL database, and a simple API layer that allows conversations and messages to be stored permanently. With Supabase, CadeGPT will support user accounts, persistent chat history, conversation memory, and usage tracking. This transforms the project from a local AI demo into a scalable foundation for a real SaaS-style AI product, while still remaining on a free tier for development.

The technology stack includes Python 3.9, FastAPI, Pydantic, Uvicorn, Ollama, HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The system is configured using environment variables so that secrets are never committed to GitHub and AI providers can be swapped without touching the application code. The entire project is designed to be clean, modular, and easy to understand for both developers and recruiters reviewing the repository.

CadeGPT exists as both a learning platform and a portfolio-ready AI application. It demonstrates full-stack engineering, API design, AI system integration, and modern software architecture patterns. It is not a simple chatbot but a well-structured AI platform that can evolve into a real product over time.
